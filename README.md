### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to build an app with React while also using React libraries such as react router, styled components, and proptypes. This project was built by following a React tutorial by FreeCodeCamp and its purpose was to learn the fundamentals of React. I learned fundamental concepts such as state and props. I learned the differences between class and functional components. This project was first built with only class components and then refactored into functional components.
